# 09 Lists

## Introduction
In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Lists allow you to store multiple items in a single variable and are one of the most versatile and commonly used data types in Python. Lists are defined by square brackets `[]` and can contain any type of elements, such as integers, strings, or even other lists.

## Creating a List. You can create a list by placing a sequence of elements inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.

# Example of a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# List with mixed data types
mixed_list = [1, "Hello", 3.14, True]

## Accessing List Elements. Each item in a list has an index that allows you to access it. The first item has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.

# Accessing the first item
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1

# Accessing the second item
print(mixed_list[1])  # Output: Hello
Negative Indexing
Negative indexing allows you to access items from the end of the list.

# Accessing the last item
print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 5

## Modifying a List. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after they have been created.

# Changing the value of the first element
my_list[0] = 10
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Common List Operations. Here are some common operations you can perform on lists.

Adding Elements
append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
insert(): Adds an element at a specified position.

my_list.append(6)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
my_list.insert(1, 15)  # Output: [10, 15, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Removing Elements
remove(): Removes the first occurrence of the specified value.
pop(): Removes and returns the element at the specified position (or the last element if no index is specified).

my_list.remove(2)  # Output: [10, 15, 3, 4, 5, 6]
my_list.pop(2)  # Output: [10, 15, 4, 5, 6]

## List Length. To find the number of elements in a list, use the len() function.

print(len(my_list))  # Output: 6

## Slicing a List. You can slice a list to access a subset of its elements.


# Accessing elements from index 1 to 3 (excluding 4)
sub_list = my_list[1:4]
print(sub_list)  # Output: [15, 4, 5]

## Iterating Over a List. You can use loops to iterate over the elements in a list.


# Loop through a list
for item in my_list:
    print(item)

## List Comprehensions. List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

# Create a list of squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

## Conclusion. Lists are a powerful data structure in Python, allowing you to store and manipulate a collection of elements. With the ability to change, add, and remove items, they are extremely flexible and useful in a wide range of programming tasks.
