# 12 Sets

## Introduction
In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not allow duplicate elements, and the elements in a set are not indexed, meaning there is no way to access items using an index. Sets are mainly used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.

## Creating a Set
You can create a set by placing a sequence of items separated by commas inside curly braces `{}`.

```python
# Example of a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Set with mixed data types
mixed_set = {1, "Hello", 3.14, False}
Creating an Empty Set
You cannot create an empty set with {}, as this will create an empty dictionary. Instead, use the set() function to create an empty set.


# Creating an empty set
empty_set = set()
Set Characteristics
Unordered: The items have no defined order and can appear in any order.
No duplicates: Sets automatically remove duplicates.

# Sets remove duplicate elements
duplicate_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}
print(duplicate_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Adding and Removing Elements
Sets are mutable, meaning you can add and remove items after the set has been created.

Adding Elements
Use the add() method to add a single element to a set, and update() to add multiple elements.


my_set.add(6)  # Adds a single element
my_set.update([7, 8, 9])  # Adds multiple elements
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Removing Elements
Use the remove() or discard() method to remove a specific element. The difference between the two is that remove() will raise an error if the element is not found, while discard() will not.


my_set.remove(3)  # Removes the element 3
my_set.discard(10)  # Will not raise an error even though 10 is not in the set
The pop() method removes and returns an arbitrary element (since sets are unordered, there is no "last" element).


removed_item = my_set.pop()
print(removed_item)  # Removes a random item from the set
Clearing a Set
To remove all elements from a set, use the clear() method.


my_set.clear()
print(my_set)  # Output: set()
Set Operations
Python sets support various operations that are useful for comparing sets and performing mathematical operations.

Union
The union of two sets combines all unique elements from both sets. Use the union() method or the | operator.


set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {3, 4, 5}

union_set = set_a.union(set_b)
# Or using the pipe operator
union_set = set_a | set_b

print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Intersection
The intersection of two sets is a set of elements that appear in both sets. Use the intersection() method or the & operator.


intersection_set = set_a.intersection(set_b)
# Or using the ampersand operator
intersection_set = set_a & set_b

print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}
Difference
The difference between two sets is the set of elements that are in the first set but not in the second. Use the difference() method or the - operator.


difference_set = set_a.difference(set_b)
# Or using the minus operator
difference_set = set_a - set_b

print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
Symmetric Difference
The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. Use the symmetric_difference() method or the ^ operator.


symmetric_difference_set = set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b)
# Or using the caret operator
symmetric_difference_set = set_a ^ set_b

print(symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
Set Comparisons
You can compare sets to determine subset, superset, or disjoint relationships.

Subset: A set is a subset of another if all elements of the first set are in the second.
Superset: A set is a superset of another if it contains all elements of the second set.
Disjoint: Two sets are disjoint if they have no elements in common.

set_x = {1, 2, 3}
set_y = {1, 2}

# Subset
print(set_y.issubset(set_x))  # Output: True

# Superset
print(set_x.issuperset(set_y))  # Output: True

# Disjoint
set_z = {4, 5}
print(set_x.isdisjoint(set_z))  # Output: True
Iterating Over a Set
You can loop through the elements in a set using a for loop.


for item in set_a:
    print(item)
Set Comprehensions
Like list comprehensions, you can create sets using set comprehensions.


# Example: Creating a set of squares
squares = {x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)  # Output: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}
Conclusion
Sets are a powerful and efficient way to store unique elements and perform operations such as union, intersection, and difference. Understanding sets and their operations can greatly simplify tasks involving comparisons or eliminating duplicates.
