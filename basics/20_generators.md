# 20 Generators

## Introduction
Generators in Python are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. Unlike regular functions, which return a single value and terminate, generators yield values one at a time, suspending their state in between each `yield`. This allows generators to produce items lazily (only when needed), making them highly memory-efficient when dealing with large data sets or infinite sequences.

### Defining a Generator
A generator is defined like a regular function but uses the `yield` keyword instead of `return`.

### Example:

```python
def count_up_to(max_value):
    count = 1
    while count <= max_value:
        yield count
        count += 1

# Create a generator object
counter = count_up_to(5)

# Iterate over the generator
for number in counter:
    print(number)
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
In this example, yield pauses the function and returns the current value. When the function is called again, it resumes from where it left off.

Generator vs. Function
A regular function computes and returns all its results at once, whereas a generator produces its results lazily. Generators are especially useful when working with large data sets because they donâ€™t need to store all the data in memory at once.

Example (Regular Function vs Generator):
# Regular function
def square_numbers(numbers):
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        result.append(num ** 2)
    return result

# Generator function
def square_numbers_gen(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        yield num ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(square_numbers(numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
print(list(square_numbers_gen(numbers)))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
Memory Efficiency
The main advantage of generators is that they are memory-efficient. Instead of creating an entire list in memory, a generator produces one item at a time.

Example:
def infinite_sequence():
    num = 0
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1

# Infinite generator
gen = infinite_sequence()

# Print the first 5 numbers of the infinite sequence
for _ in range(5):
    print(next(gen))
This generator produces an infinite sequence of numbers without storing them in memory. You can use the next() function to manually retrieve the next item.

The next() Function
The next() function is used to manually get the next value from a generator. When the generator is exhausted (i.e., there are no more values to produce), it raises a StopIteration exception.

Example:
gen = count_up_to(3)
print(next(gen))  # Output: 1
print(next(gen))  # Output: 2
print(next(gen))  # Output: 3
# print(next(gen))  # Raises StopIteration
Generator Expressions
Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses () instead of square brackets []. They create a generator object that produces values lazily.

Example:
# List comprehension
squares_list = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares_list)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

# Generator expression
squares_gen = (x ** 2 for x in range(5))
print(squares_gen)  # Output: <generator object>
print(list(squares_gen))  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
Using Generators with for Loops
You can use generators directly in for loops, as they are iterators. This allows you to process large data sets incrementally without loading everything into memory.

Example:
def fibonacci(limit):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < limit:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Using the generator in a for loop
for num in fibonacci(10):
    print(num)
Output:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
Using yield to Create Pipelines
Generators can be chained together to create data pipelines. This allows for efficient data processing, as each generator processes one item at a time.

Example:
# Generator to filter even numbers
def filter_even(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            yield num

# Generator to square numbers
def square(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        yield num ** 2

# Chain the generators together
numbers = range(10)
even_squares = square(filter_even(numbers))

for num in even_squares:
    print(num)
Output:

0
4
16
36
64
Conclusion
Generators are a powerful feature in Python that enable you to create iterators in a memory-efficient manner. By using yield, you can write functions that produce values lazily, making them ideal for processing large data sets or creating infinite sequences. Additionally, generator expressions offer a concise way to create generators in one line.
