# Variables in Python


### What Are Variables?

In Python, a **variable** is a reserved memory location to store values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python doesn't require you to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter infers the type automatically based on the assigned value.

### Naming Conventions

- **Letters, Numbers, and Underscores:** Variable names can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores (`_`).
- **Cannot Start with a Number:** Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore, not a number.
- **Case-Sensitive:** Python treats `myVariable`, `MyVariable`, and `MYVARIABLE` as three distinct variables.
- **No Reserved Keywords:** Avoid using Python's reserved keywords (like `class`, `for`, `if`, etc.) as variable names.

### Examples of Variable Assignment

```python
# Assigning an integer to a variable
age = 25

# Assigning a floating-point number to a variable
temperature = 98.6

# Assigning a string to a variable
name = "Alice"

# Assigning a boolean to a variable
is_student = True
